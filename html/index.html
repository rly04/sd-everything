    <h1>Cats are Evil ?!</h1>
    <p>
Look. Cats are plotting something. And I won't turn a blind eye like everyone else. This shit is real. It's more real than life itself. Cats are always watching, in the shadows. They can sense our fear, they know that we know something is coming. But we don't expect a innocent cat to do some horrendous crime such as mass genocide on a massive scale. This is just the way things are. But they know that, they know we think it's something else. It gives them the percent chance to strike us down. They are just waiting for people like me to drop their guard. Unluckily for them I won't be dropping it anytime soon. So accept the truth or perish like the rest of you hypocritical shit stains who are to blind to see the truth of cats: they are evil. Man. This shit is so good. Over to copypasta to spread the awareness.
